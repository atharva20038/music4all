# Mustango

</div>


## Quickstart Guide

Generate music from a text prompt:

```python
import IPython
import soundfile as sf
from mustango import Mustango

model = Mustango("declare-lab/mustango")

prompt = "This is a new age piece. There is a flute playing the main melody with a lot of staccato notes. The rhythmic background consists of a medium tempo electronic drum beat with percussive elements all over the spectrum. There is a playful atmosphere to the piece. This piece can be used in the soundtrack of a children's TV show or an advertisement jingle."

music = model.generate(prompt)
sf.write(f"{prompt}.wav", audio, samplerate=16000)
IPython.display.Audio(data=music, rate=16000)
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/mustango
cd mustango
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
```


## Training

We use the `accelerate` package from Hugging Face for multi-gpu training. Run `accelerate config` from terminal and set up your run configuration by the answering the questions asked.

You can now train **Mustango** on the MusicBench dataset using:

```bash
accelerate launch train.py \
--text_encoder_name="google/flan-t5-large" \
--scheduler_name="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1" \
--unet_model_config="configs/diffusion_model_config_munet.json" \
--model_type Mustango --freeze_text_encoder --uncondition_all --uncondition_single \
--drop_sentences --random_pick_text_column --snr_gamma 5 \
```

The `--model_type` flag allows to choose either Mustango, or Tango to be trained with the same code. However, do note that you also need to change `--unet_model_config` to the relevant config: diffusion_model_config_munet for Mustango; diffusion_model_config for Tango.

The arguments `--uncondition_all`, `--uncondition_single`, `--drop_sentences` control the dropout functions as per Section 5.2 in our paper. The argument of `--random_pick_text_column` allows to randomly pick between two input text prompts - in the case of MusicBench, we pick between ChatGPT rephrased captions and original enhanced MusicCaps prompts, as depicted in Figure 1 in our paper.

Recommended training time from scratch on MusicBench is at least 40 epochs.
