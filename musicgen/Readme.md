## Explanation of Key Components:
- **Pretrained Model**: A foundation model (`facebook/musicgen-medium`) that is fine-tuned for a specific task.
- **Adapter Bottleneck**: A technique to introduce lightweight modifications without retraining the entire model.
- **Batch Size**: A lower batch size (4) is used, likely due to memory constraints with large audio models.
- **Dropout**: Helps prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating parts of the model during training.
- **Gradient Clipping**: Ensures stability in training by capping large gradient updates.
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents unnecessary training epochs if validation loss stops improving.

This configuration is optimized for fine-tuning **MusicGen** with **adapter-based modifications** for improved music generation capabilities.

# Inference Configuration

This table provides an overview of the key parameters used in the **inference process** for generating music.

| Parameter                 | Description                                               | Value                                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pretrained Model**      | Name of the pre-trained MusicGen model used for inference. | `facebook/musicgen-medium`                                  |
| **Fine-tuned Model Path** | Path where the fine-tuned model is stored.                | `./ModelsFinetuned/New/MusicgenMedium_with_adapters_EncoderDecoder.pt` |
| **Output Audio Path**     | Path where the generated audio file is saved.             | `./GeneratedAudios/1.wav`                                  |
| **Waveform Graph Path**   | Path where the waveform visualization is stored.          | `./GeneratedGraphs/1.jpeg`                                 |
| **Sample Rate**           | Desired sample rate for the generated audio.              | `16,000 Hz`                                                |
| **Adapter Bottleneck Dim**| Size of the bottleneck layer in the adapter network.      | `32`                                                     |
| **Max New Tokens**        | Controls the length of the generated music (512 â‰ˆ 10 sec). | `512`                                                      |
| **Device**               | Specifies whether to use GPU or CPU for inference.        | `CUDA if available, else CPU`                             |
| **Use Fine-tuned Model**  | Determines whether to use the fine-tuned model or pre-trained. | `True` (uses fine-tuned model)                            |

## Explanation of Key Components:
- **Pretrained Model**: Uses `facebook/musicgen-medium`, which is fine-tuned for customized music generation.
- **Fine-tuned Model Path**: If `use_finetuned_model = True`, the model loads from this path.
- **Waveform Graph Path**: Saves the waveform visualization as an image.
- **Max New Tokens**: Higher values generate longer music samples.
- **Device Selection**: Automatically chooses GPU (if available) for faster inference.

### ðŸ”¥ How the Inference Works:
1. The **model is loaded** (`pre-trained` or `fine-tuned` based on configuration).
2. The user **inputs a text prompt** describing the music to be generated.
3. The model **generates an audio waveform** based on the text input.
4. The generated music is **saved as a `.wav` file**.
5. A **waveform graph** is plotted and saved for visualization.

This setup ensures **efficient, high-quality music generation** using **MusicGen with adapter-based fine-tuning**. ðŸš€
